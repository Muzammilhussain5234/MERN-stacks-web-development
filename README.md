This repository contains my web development work using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and other modern tools. 
It includes projects like MongoDB setup, React.js apps, API connections, and complete websites. Basic JavaScript, Express.js files, and practice exercises are not added here because they are already in my JavaScript repository. Youâ€™ll also find Next.js projects and other tools I learn over time. I will keep updating this repository as I build new things and improve my skills. 
This is where I collect and share everything I work on during my learning journey.
